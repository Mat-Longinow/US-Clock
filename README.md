# US Clock

This is a personal project I made to practice JavaScript. It is a clock that continuously updates with times pulled from the UTC and adjusted to different US time zones that you can toggle back and forth between.

This app was built with the following technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
